            <p>I first became a laker fan in 2008.
            Unfortunately the lakers actually ended up losing that year in the finals to the celtics. 
            The next two years was for revenge as they won in 2009 and 2010.
            When the lakers were playing, I was just in shock of how they played compared to everyone else and how they perfected the triangle offense. 
            Watching the lakers inspired me to play basketball. Ever since, I started playing basketball. 
            The Lakers are my favorite basketball team and I grew up watching them.
            My favorite basketball player of all time has to be Kobe Bryant and my favorite player right now is Lebron James. 
            I always buy new gear for the lakers and my wish is to go to one of their games one day. Also, meeting one of the players would make my day and i will cherish it forever. 
            The lakers are a very historic team and have one of the bigger fan bases in the league. Overall the lakers are an icon to NBA basketball but in the last 5 years they haven't made the playoffs. 
            With the newly aqquisition of Lebron James and others the lakers look to take their young core of players into the playoffs this season. 
            I look forward to the upcoming NBA season with all the shakeups this season and I believe in the next 3 years that the lakers will win the championship. </p>

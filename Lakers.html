            <p>LeBron James is coming to the Lakers.
            The four-time NBA MVP and three-time league champion chose the Lakers within the first 24 hours of NBA free agency, agreeing to a four-year deal worth $154 million, which he can sign as early as July 6.
            James’ decision changes the league’s balance of power and gives the Lakers front office led by president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka a long-anticipated offseason triumph. 
            Teams that have LeBron James typically win a lot of games, and that's the scenario the Lakers find themselves in right now after James announced his decision to sign with the Lakers on Sunday night. 
            Back in early June, the Lakers were given title odds around 16-1. Decent odds, but nothing spectacular. However, now that they've signed James, the Lakers odds have increased.
Westgate Sportsbook currently has the Lakers' odds set at 7-2, with the Warriors set as favorites to win another title at 10-11. 
The Celtics are also at 7-2, while the Rockets are close behind at 7-1.They are also coming off a 35-47 season that again saw them miss out on the playoffs for the fifth year in a row. 
Despite all of that, Las Vegas believes this ragtag group is the fifth most likely to win the title next season. And most of that has to do with LeBron James. 
Lonzo Ball flashed promise on offense and a will to affect the game on defense. Kyle Kuzma was an astounding find for the Lakers, as was Josh Hart.
The Lakers also tout Brandon Ingram, who proved capable of being that consistent power on offense. L.A. has depth but lacks both veteran polish and legitimate star power. LeBron James solves both those issues. 
Now if you are looking for better odds, you may want to see if James even signs with L.A., because a commitment to anywhere else would see the Lakers plummet in Vegas.
Murray continues, “Without him, they'd probably be in the 60-1 to 80-1 range.” Still, it’s incredible that the mere whispers and suggestion of a James arrival has the Lakers in the hunt as far as Vegas is concerned. 
I’ll steer clear of saying L.A. is on the cusp of a title and merely say that it’s essentially one legendary player away from contending.

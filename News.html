            <p>The Los Angeles Lakers won free agency this summer by agreeing on a four-year, $154 million deal with LeBron James. 
            But in the days since, their moves have been a bizarre series of heat checks. 
            They've brought in known LeBron nemesis Lance Stephenson, as well as JaVale McGee and Rajon Rondo.
            Not only are they strange moves because, well, they aren't exactly great players, but they also don't fit too well with LeBron's style of play. 
            Most notably, none of them are good 3-point shooters, and the Lakers were already the second-worst 3-point shooting team in the league last season.
            And as we've seen throughout his career, LeBron operates best with the ball in his hands and shooters spaced out around him. 
            It should come as little surprise to hear that LeBron is on board with these moves.
            There obviously aren't going to be any reports leaked from either the Lakers or his camp that he's already frustrated before he's even technically signed the contract.
            And maybe he really is OK with these deals. After all, they're only for one year, and the Lakers probably aren't contending this year anyway. But man.
On paper, you can see where the Lakers are going with this, in trying to add some more versatile defenders and playmakers, but were Stephenson, Rondo and McGee really the players to fill out that vision? 
Yes, it might allow LeBron to play off-ball some more this season, but that's not going to work as well as it could with no one who can space the floor. 
Plus, he's still going to have the ball in his hands for large stretches of the game. 
We'll see how this goes, but the Lakers might want to start making those moves to acquire a little shooting sooner rather than later.

            <p>Luol Deng agreed to a significant give-back of $7.5 million in his contract buyout with the Los Angeles Lakers, clearing $38 million in salary cap space for 2019 free agency.
            The Lakers can now offer a free-agent star a maximum contract in July to partner with LeBron James. 
            The Lakers are targeting the top players in a potentially starry 2019 marketplace, including Toronto's Kawhi Leonard, Golden State's Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson and Minnesota's Jimmy Butler.
            Deng's buyout leaves him with $29 million for the two years left on his contract, which the Lakers will use the waive and stretch provision to soften the short-term salary cap hit. 
            The significant money that Deng, 33, gave up reflects how determined he's been to continue his career elsewhere.
            The Lakers could've waited until next summer to use the waive and stretch provision without Deng's financial concessions.
            But Deng wouldn't have any incentive to do a buyout next summer, knowing the Lakers would need to do so in order to create a max contract slot.
            His incentive this year was to create an opportunity to play elsewhere this year. The Lakers incentive was to create a maximum slot for next summer without giving up an asset in a trade to shed Deng's contract.
            The stretch provision projects Deng to impact the Lakers salary cap $4.99 million a year from 2019-20 to 2021-22.
            If they'd waited until next summer without any buyout, they'd have to stretch approximately $6 million per year over the three seasons.

            <p>LiAngelo Ball thought he was going to hear his name called during the 2018 NBA Draft, but it was not to be.
Liangelo ball had his hopes up high to get drafted by either the Lakers or the Suns.
"LiAngelo Ball expected to land with either the Los Angeles Lakers or Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 2018 NBA draft, a revelation that came out during the most recent episode of Ball in the Family.
Instead, the Lakers selected Svi Mykhailiuk with the 47th overall pick, and the Suns wrapped up their draft by adding George King with the 59th pick.
On the night of the draft, Ball was watching his brother LaMelo compete in the Junior Basketball Association, the league founded by LaVar Ball and Big Baller Brand. After the Lakers selected Mykhailiuk, Ball left his courtside seat to follow the draft on television and saw King come off the board to Phoenix."
This is how Ball reflected on not being drafted at all in the 2018 NBA Draft: 
"It sucks I didn’t get drafted tonight," Ball reflected. "I guess it was the way I played. I guess. At this point, I’m just […] I’m good."
LiAngelo worked out for multiple teams before the draft and had many conversations which led him to believe that he would get drafted.
While his brother Lonzo got selected as the second pick last year , LiAngelo hasn't had it easy to get a spot on NBA roster.
Following his arrest at UCLA for shoplifting, the LaVar Ball effect and due to the fact that he just isn't a surefire prospect like his older brother was, teams are refusing to give LiAngelo a chance.
Not only is Ball not currently on an NBA roster, he didn't even get a chance during Summer League.
After leaving the UCLA team, LiAngelo had played last season professionally for the Lithuanian team BC Vytautas, averaging 12.6 points, 2.9 rebounds and 0.9 assists in 14 Lithuanian league games.
Due to the amount of unwanted attention his dad LaVar gets, his past history and that he's nowhere near a top prospect, it looks like LiAngelo is facing an uphill battle just to receive a shot in the NBA.

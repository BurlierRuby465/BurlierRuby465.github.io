            <p>LeBron James is coming to the Lakers. The four-time NBA MVP and three-time league champion chose the Lakers within the first 24 hours of NBA free agency, agreeing to a four-year deal worth $154 million, which he can sign as early as July 6. James’ decision changes the league’s balance of power and gives the Lakers front office led by president of basketball operations Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka a long-anticipated offseason triumph. .Teams that have LeBron James typically win a lot of games, and that's the scenario the Lakers find themselves in right now after James announced his decision to sign with the Lakers on Sunday night. Back in early June, the Lakers were given title odds around 16-1. Decent odds, but nothing spectacular. However, now that they've signed James, the Lakers odds have increased.
Westgate Sportsbook currently has the Lakers' odds set at 7-2, with the Warriors set as favorites to win another title at 10-11. The Celtics are also at 7-2, while the Rockets are close behind at 7-1.
